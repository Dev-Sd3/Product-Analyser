If other reviews are going to show the same results im going to cancel my preorder and just get 12 Pro. Very disappointing

EDIT: alright, after verge and mrwhoistheboss reviews I can see the improvements. Not 50% better light photos as I hoped but still better. Also, shorter night mode time coupled with better stabilisation will make the night time images sharper, since i rarely use tripod. I will keep the preorder  


Also interesting bit from dave2d is that 89% camera improvement for Pro Max that is advertised on the website is compared to 11 generation. He said the jump in low light photo from Pro to Pro Max is 10-15% improvement",752,PM_ME_CUTE_SM1LE

I have really big hands and I mean REALLY BIG hands. To give you an idea of how big, my iPhone 7 plus fits in my hand, with a thick waterproof case on, and I still have almost an inch of room between the tip of my index finger and the top of my phone. I have almost and inch and a half of room between the tip of my middle finger and the top of the phone, so ya... I have big hands.

&#x200B;

So for me a really big phone, plus a huge battery and camera upgrade, are all pluses to me over buying any of the other phones. All these reviews complaining about the phone size are a plus for me because it means I will have a huge screen to work with, plus all the other benefits of the pro max. And trust me when I say I watch a TON of YouTube videos so I will be putting the battery through the numbers. So basically there is nothing negative about this phone that I've seen so far to make me regret my purchase.",7,The_Space_Wolf_

Coming from big android phones for many years, I was wary in the beginning of choosing the smaller pro instead of the max. But because the 12 pro didn’t have that many compromises to the max, I chose the smaller size. And with me not an avid photographer, Im glad I chose the smaller size. Now, if Apple actually made better use of the screen size, like fitting more on the screen, allowing split screen apps, then maybe I would have chosen the max.

The camera is better than the 12 Pro but marginally. Don’t buy the Pro Max for the Camera. Rather the battery and the large Display! But The Verge spoke well about the camera but they compared it to the Pixel, Samsung etc. Apple had us all hyped up for the new Pro Max though. 

The only reason I’m switching from my my X is for the camera and the battery. I rarely use my X to click pictures. My Pixel 3 is my go to for confident and sharp images. But my iPhone X is my main phone.

I have a 12 Pro now that I haven't set up yet, because maybe I want to return it and get a Max. The 12 Pro feels smaller than the XR/11 and I hate that the Max has a slightly better camera, especially since I use the telephoto lens all the time. But the Max is probably gonna feel way too big.

- Battery Life very good, ends day on ~25% with 6-7 hours of SOT. Comparable to 11 Pro Max (slightly less).

- Camera difference vs Pro is nowhere near as big as expected. He expected better night time photography, less of a need for night mode and less need to hold still in night mode. He found none of these. There’s still halo effects from lights in nighttime photo/video.

Most people will not notice the difference between a crop and full frame sensor during daylight hours, and with the way software/hardware has gotten better at handling ISO, the lower light benefits are not as great as they once were.  They’re still there just because larger sensors will always let in more light, but your average Joe Schmoe isn’t going to tell when viewing on insta/whatever.

99% of the shots you’ll be taking will look the same as the regular pro.  

That 1% when you are in super low light and still want to take a photo handheld is where this extra $100 comes in. 
You can still achieve the same shot with a tripod with a longer exposure.

So when i got the gift you can imagine i did the same and ordered the Defender. It dropped from a table that's barely waist high and landed screen down, picked it up and it was nearly completely cracked and half the screen was black and i had read a few complaints of the same thing happening and due to the design of the Galaxy screen how it rolls around to give that infinity look and that makes it stick out too far that it doesn't protect it like the rest of iPhone. I preordered the iPhone 12 pro max this go around and you can damn well bet i bought another Otterbox defender that's normally $59.99 and you can bet that i didn't feel bad in any way shape or form to use the old warranty trick that still works with them and lifeproof ( believe they are the same company) and got a brand new case for the simple price of $7 bucks which is just the shipping. 

warranty>12 pro max defender case> purchased in store> just clicked Monday for the week so i believe it was the 2nd> stated the tabs were broke when i received it> new case on the way for 7 bucks. Straight score  


(wouldn't have done it had they provided any help with the screen repair since its a known problem that it doesn't live up to the standards and expectations... so if you would like a new otterbox the old warranty trick still works after a couple years. Enjoy",1,_Dreadz

It certainly isn't the usual XR/11 Ferrari Red, and the drastic change may be a deal-breaker for some even if I appreciate it. 

I am a bit more concerned about early reports of bad battery life while using mmWave 5G on the Pro. Ultimately, I am unlikely to encounter such issues in my rural area - however, it would be quite aggravating if 5G can't be toggled off to conserve power.

The 11 Pro Max had android level battery specs, with a 4,000 mah battery. It was kickass for lasting.

Looks like the 12 pro Max has a 3,600 cell, but also has 5G so on paper it would seem to do worse (if you keep 5G on). However the 5nm A14 chip should balance it out the same battery life as the 11 Pro Max in efficiency which is why they can afford the smaller cell battery.

With every phone, you can tell what it was designed *around*. There’s some key feature that everything else has to contend with, that sets the hardware narrative. For many years now, that feature was the screen. Making it big, bright, beautiful, and bezel-less was the big thing driving phone design, and all other considerations were secondary.  
>  
>The iPhone 12 mini feels like the first iPhone in a long time with a different goal. It was designed around the human hand and real pockets. It is an object that doesn’t aim to be judged against other smartphones (which are mostly big now), but to be judged simply as an object you need to hold. You judge a spatula or can opener or whatever by whether it’s easy to grip, by whether it fits in your hand. It’s about time we got back to judging smartphones that way, too.  
>  
>That design decision means that other things — like battery life — are secondary. But it’s nevertheless a strange kind of relief to hold it. You know the feeling when a buzzing noise you’d grown accustomed to suddenly stops and you realize you’ve been annoyed all day but couldn’t say why? It’s like that.  
>  
>Whether we admit it or not (and whether we hate it or not), we’ve subtly been adapting ourselves to ever-growing phone sizes. The iPhone 12 mini is adapted to *us*.

Overwhelmingly the reviews are saying this phone is perfect except for battery life. 

Apples never going to be comfortable releasing a mini and a pro mini where the pro mini has a smaller battery than the regular mini. 

Meaning that If they did make a pro mini they would likely handicap the regular mini to have the same battery as the pro. While not utilising the extra internal space on the regular. 


We have already seen that play out this year between the 12 and 12 Pro. 

The 12 has identical internals and battery to the 12 Pro, except for a plastic spacer where the 12 pro has a third camera and LiDAR scanner. 

If Apple had designed the 12 to be its own thing then that space wouldn’t be there and theoretically the 12 could have had a fractionally bigger battery. 

None of this matters all that much in the 12 the battery is good enough. 

But the reviews for them mini are that it’s just a bit shy of good enough. 

So the only priority for the mini should be optimising the space inside to get a larger battery in there. 

Please people, battery life is more important than cameras. 

The best camera is the one you have on you and if your phone is dead. It don’t matter how good the camera is. 

So let’s not demand a pro mini, don’t convince Apple to further cram extra cameras or LiDAR scanners into the mini. 

Miniaturise everything. Make the 5G radios smaller, Save as much space as possible and put a bigger battery in there. 


Honestly I’d if it was up to me I’d scrap the 5G, and at a pinch the ultra wide and use that saved space to get a bigger battery in there.  

(Or just make it one or two mm thicker)

All that said I hope the regular and mini phones get 6gb of ram next year and I see no reason why the mini shouldn’t be able to shoot Dolby vision at 60fps and have ProRaw",17,Portatort

The blue + Saddle Brown makes for a nice, flashy, and elegant combination, but then black + black has this sleek, sexy minimalist look that goes well with a small iPhone because it’s reminiscent of the many years where I used to buy black iPhones with black cases.

My girlfriend and myself are looking to buy a new phone. We both have a first generation SE and both phones are struggling, so a a replacement is overdue. We are especially unhappy about the battery: we often have to charge our phones 2-3 times per day, even though we are working from home office and we don't use the phones as much as we would normally in a non-coronavirus world. After reading through the news in the morning, my phone is already at 70%, even though I just took off the charger.

We will continue working from home office until next June, but battery is still a concern for us. We use our phone for texting, calls, reading the news, listening to music and podcasts. We are not heavy users, we don't usually watch videos or play games.

We are considering the new SE, the 11 or the 12 mini. The new SE is attractive because of the price, but I think I would feel unhappy about the form and the screen, and as far as I know, battery is also a concern. The 12 mini looks great and I love the size, but I don't want to experience the same issues with the battery as I am experiencing now with the SE. The 11 is bigger than what I would like and I prefer the design of the 12 mini over the 11, but as far as I know, it's a battery champ, so maybe we will go for that one.

I personally have a few minor complaints.

-	Battery life seems like a slight downgrade from the year before. It’s still decent (and pretty good on the Max model), but it seemed better the year before.
-	making such a deal of 5G is dumb. It currently has little to no coverage, and is using modems that aren’t that energy efficient, which means that if you actually want to use it, battery life will take a hit. 
-	no 120 Hz is still pretty sad. I remember saying it wasn’t a big deal until using a note 20 ultra. Holy crap, it seems like a dumb upgrade but the phone feels considerably better when using it. I can only imagine what would be of the smooth iOS animations with this refresh rate.
-	spec wise it is pretty meh. I don’t understand why apple won’t put a bigger battery and more ram. I know iPhone performs equally with less specs, but they could have a considerably better device with a larger battery and more ram. It would future proof it a lot. 
-	the front design is starting to look updated. As much as I dislike the hole punch, it is less distracting that the large notch we have now. I don’t hate it, but it should be smaller by now",5,hehaia

The iPhone 12 will be the model most people should get because they don’t need the extra camera lens, RAM, or storage options. The Pro Max isn’t much more than the regular Pro but not everyone wants the larger display and I’m not sure if the camera upgrades will translate to real-world results without pixel peeping.

I have a point-and-shoot camera with a 1” sensor, a mirrorless with an APS-C, and a full frame. Unless I’m hunting through pixels, I can’t see much of a difference between images in most situations. Low light video on the full frame is better but the image processing with the APS-C and even 1” get both of them close enough that my wife can’t tell the difference on our Samsung QLED (all at 4K 24/30/60fps). Low light photos often come out better on the 1”, without post processing, because it has better built-in processing with newer techniques. My full frame will take better lowlight shots in the end but it takes more post processing to make that happen.

I could be wrong and the Pro Max could make a huge difference. But I went with the middle child because I can still use it with one hand, the bump in RAM is noticeable for me since I’m constantly switching between 5-6 apps, I use the zoom lens all the time, and I alarmist always have my point-and-shoot with me which will take better photos (with more zoom) than any smartphone and can record HDR 4K video up to 60fps (HLG+) and take 1080p 240fps slow motion.",6,P_Devil

I recently got an Apple refurbished iPhone 12 mini, but it seems there is something wrong with the camera. I just want to know if I should return it. The camera does not balance light well at all, and everything that is slightly illuminated becomes overexposed – even when I manually lower the exposure!

Please see the examples attached. The first picture is what the camera automatically did while I was focusing on my cat. When I reduced the exposure, it still overexposed his white fur.  I had an iPhone 11 in the past and it seemed to do a better job actually. Is this normal for the 12 mini?

Also while Marques is fair in his review, I would not call his review a deep dive. I would wait for Anandtech or dpreview(just for camera). No one does deep dive as well as anandtech while dpreview provides professional perspective. But those reviews will take quite some time as they dont get ""review units"" from OEMs. 

Also I am curious about the sensor used in 12 pro max. I am assuming its IMX sensor. Sony uses IMX557 on its flagship with similar pixel size. Galaxy S20/S20+ uses IMX555. That said some of the other android flagships have way bigger sensor. Huawei uses 1/1.28"" IMX700(but RYYB sensor). Samsung uses 1/1.33"" sensor while Xiaomi uses 1/1.32"" from image vision. I think in next few generations Apple will keep putting bigger sensor. I also hope they put in periscope lens at some point. At least in Pro Max phone.

I’m also sure that Apple will probably send some updates in the future to improve on the camera, it’s just really hard to believe that having a sensor that’s almost 50% larger and having sensor shift technology doesn’t produce better images.",1,joeyg151785

He showed full screen photos side by side in a VIDEO fully zoomed out and you surely cannot make out extra details at that size and video resolution. Infact in a video with the photos full zoomed out, I would argue that you wont be able to make out the difference between a full frame DSLR photo and a photo from an competent flagship phone in good light. To seriously judge what the camera is doing, you have to get into per pixel level detail and I could surely see the difference between 12 Pro Max and 12 Pro.",1,lavkesh81

If you buy the iPhone 8 it won't get updates for as long as this one.

You can get it for a cheaper price if you sell your old iPhone or trade it in.

If you want value for your money that can be found with older android phones. If you want value for your money and don't care about anything else you probably are not looking at buying an iPhone.

I would personally prefer something like the upcoming Pixel 4a.

I literally never seem he not praise nor take a bad photo withe the iPhones, ever since his first reviews. Not saying that the cameras are bad, but all of the phone cameras are currently on level play field and a great photographer will create exceptional work with any high-end phone. Heck, even low-end phones like the Pixel line have amazing cameras (for a phone).

The real comparison should be a phone vs entry-level DSLR. And while this doesn’t affect most of the market, the truth is: software simply can’t match (yet?) the physical dimensions of an ASP-C or Full Frame sensor.

Any entre level camera will produce images that clearly one step ahead of the best smartphone cameras. And more and more I feel less compelled to compare them or even see the reviews bc they feel stale. Yeah, it lets some more light enter, or the Pro Max has a 20% bigger sensor... but the sensor is still 1/10th the size of a cropped camera sensor a best.

And even if current cameras are “good enough”, as an enthusiast, it feels unnecessary to still be so attached to any phone camera. They all suck, compared to real cameras. But they all excel in being a good all around camera to always have with you.

Finally: I just with for a breakthrough that allows for actual big sensors to take cameras to the next level on phones. I feel like the use of mirrors & periscopic cameras is a first step towards that, but I fear we’re still lagging behind and years away. Or, if the end user is still happily with existing tech with marginal yearly improvements - even the ones make possible by software are marginal - we might actually not get amazing cameras in a long time.",7,leodw

Coming from the iPhone SE, I struggled for a week trying to make it work. I liked the new camera features and larger screen for my old eyes enough to “go big” and try the bigger phone. In the end, It was just too big for my hands. I hated having to use 2 hands all the time and when I did use one hand, the phone teetered precariously in my hand while trying to grip the bottom or top while I tried to reach for buttons. I even had the reachability and back tap set up to improve use ability. While it was helpful,  there was just too many compromises and I couldn’t see myself suffering for the next 4-5 years. The Mini is just awesome to use. It almost feels like I never left the SE. Physically, it’s slightly larger than the SE but the screen is bigger and more crisp. It fits into my back pocket and I don’t worry about bending it. While I’ll miss the advancement in the new camera/lidar, I really ~~like~~ love using my phone now. It really is a great phone.",2,KeyCapsCrazy

IR on Pixel 4xl works good with a trained face model but it gives me eye strain so I turn off face unlock and manually type the password.  Still use it for selfies, but I think P6 Pro with Dual PDAF depth of field for selfies with high iso night sight portrait mode selfies would be the next ideal/logical step for Google.

I'm excited for Pixel 6.  And I think Pixel 7 might even add dual Bluetooth audio later down the road.  So I think if Pixel 6 is a success, things might change for Google and the Pixel in a good way. Display calibration will make or break the device IMO.  It has to be perfect like an iPhone in order to steal iPhone sales and iPhone customers.  So no black clipping, grey-scale uniformity, no green tint, no white balance shifting between high and low refresh rate modes, no grey-scale tinting at different brightness levels, no black clipping at different brightness levels, d65 white point, delta e less than 1 for color accuracy -- ditto all that for the HDR10 and hdr10+ display modes etc.

Only acceptable exceptions would be intentional black clipping at minimum brightness to compensate for lack of display adjustment and intentional raised shadows and colors at maximum brightness for the same reasons.",3,Gundam_net

It's been noted the 13 series uses Sony cameras and not much different from the 12 series. 
But, as many reviewer's point out, it's the camera software that really hits the punch. Google caught onto this and turned a good camera to one of the best around....at least in a few iterations.
It'll good to see if they can really pull something out the bag with the 6 series as I'm looking for an upgrade to my trusty, but aging P30 Pro.
As for whether he has a Pixel 6 or not, there was an interesting video by 'Mrwhosetheboss' where he mentioned about the embargoes [that](https://youtu.be/9V0lXIK9DZQ) most reviewers are put under, especially during Co-Vid. That's an interesting watch.",-8,14gunners

* iPhones that are 1 model newer aint a real upgrade
* iPhones that are 2 model newer is somewhat of an upgrade
* iPhones that are 3 model newer is becoming noticeable 
* iPhones that are 4 model newer are really worth upgrading too
* iPhones that are 5 model newer should be upgraded from
* etc etc

Typical upgrade cycle for phones have lengthened from 2 years to 3 years.

So if you're on a budget you may want to upgrade to the iPhone 13 if you're on an iPhone Xs or older.

This was the first year I didnt watch for the iPhone keynote. Since iPhone X the newer iPhones are just scheduled upgrades to me and nothing ground breaking.

If you're a keen photographer then a flagship iPhone is worth buying than any Canon, Nikon, Leica etc. as 

* you amortize the iPhone over 24-36 months 
* upgrades gets pushed to you
* the iPhone's on your person almost all the time except perhaps when its charging
* iPhones are at most 1/2 pound
* iPhones can send your edited photos/work any time or any place at your leisure

I'd only buy a dedicated still camera if I were

* working photgrapher that gets revenue from it

Yes its iconic, but that doesn't mean its good. Apple could have come up with its own unique signature I think and eliminating the notch at the same time. i know apple tech is always a bit behind, but I think in today's age where I have to have a mask on everytime I go outside, it renders my phone useless and makes paying for things more slow.

I switched back to cash in the time being because of how slow it was. I sure would like to have my fingerprint ID back to make unlocking and using the phone faster.

I had the opportunity to demo a Pixel 2 a few years ago (when they were new) for a couple of weeks for my company. I didn’t have too much trouble getting used to the difference in navigation, and there were definitely things about the UI/UX that I liked, but the one thing I couldn’t get over is precisely the one thing you say is the reason Apple stands out: that buttery smooth, highly responsive interface. Even on Google’s brand-new flagship device, the interface just felt jerky and unresponsive. I mean, not like insanely so—measured likely in milliseconds and objectively imperceptible—but enough that it just didn’t feel as smooth as iOS.

Also, I found the keyboard more exact but less accurate. Hard to describe, but I think iOS, in addition to the actual autocorrect function, also has a slightly different (and possibly mildly predictive) target map overlaid on the keyboard that doesn’t actually correspond exactly with where the keys are shown on the screen but ultimately seems to more accurately predict which letter you’re intending to press. I found that the Android keyboard tended to choose the letter you actually tapped, even if it made no sense, but that made it harder for me to type with good speed/accuracy.

It’s the little things like that that keep me in the iPhone ecosystem, despite the price and other annoyances.",13,arcticmischief

This is probably due to them having no place to put these notifications since the notch is taking up the space on top of the screen, but I definitely consider this a usability issue that I will need to simply learn to live with.",5,ArchmageJesus

I moved over from Android years ago. Before that I was very anti-Apple. Felt Apple-users were arrogant and had to pay for everything. What changed me were two things. Firstly. Using Android, then, I could not sync over my contacts from Samsung to my desktop unless I downloaded a 3rd party app which never worked. I'm talking about in the time of Samsung 2 and 3. Things may have changed since, it's too late. Also, with Samsung when I had problems with the phone and my cellphone provider would or could not help I was stuck. I even called Samsung in South Korea for support. They couldn't speak English. To get help I used to go into all kinds of messageboards. People were so into their phones and how could they make changed to their hardware the cheapest and easiest way to make it faster and more robust than the guy next door. I've had problems with iphone of course, but I've got a few places I can get help. FB groups that are helpful, official Apple messageboard and Apple Care. I have never been disappointed with Apple Care. 
I moved to iphone and, honestly, haven't looked back. I don't mind not having a cracked phone to add illegal apps. Don't mind paying for apps because I know that when there is a problem I've got someone to go to for help. 
In the beginning I also had a problem exiting apps. I felt stuck as you do. It becomes second nature and you get there sooner than you think.
I feel that Apple listens to its users. Of course there are mistakes and things go wrong. Glitches. It is not perfect. They are forever updating the ios to improve it. It shows they care. 
I am also not a camera person so I don't need the Pro Max. I've got the XR and within the next couple of years I'll upgrade. I'm also soon to buy the MacBook Pro. I'll be leaving Windows os. Why? I had Windows 7 on my Desktop. I needed to pay about $200 to upgrade. If I hadn't I would not get support for 7. My anti-virus stopped supporting me because I had to upgrade to W10. I'll soon have to buy a new version of Office. That pissed me of no end.",2,SnobCooky01

I assume because the left swipe is a ‘back’ gesture in… most apps, this isn’t really a thing in iOS. And the back left gesture is by no means universal.

That leaves me manually pressing on tabs within apps (often times at the top of the screen - yes, I know there is a gesture to bring down elements with a quick thumb swipe down from the gesture bar) and it’s super annoying. In Instagram a right swipe from the Home Screen brings you to messages rather than Search, which would logically be the next ‘tab’ of the app. And within messages, you can’t swipe to ‘Rooms’ with another right swipe because swiping on *any* part of a conversation performs an action. Kind of infuriating.

Even Apple’s own apps have a lot of non-intuitive features. For example, I spent a good 20 minutes adding songs to a playlist in Apple Music, only to have that cancelled out because it doesn’t just *add*  the songs, I had to manually press ‘Done’ all the way at the top of the screen. I had just swiped back to go back to the playlist instead.

The inconsistency of the back swipe gesture is also crazy to me. In Tinder, for example, if you’re on someone’s profile the only way to go back is to press a downward facing arrow in the middle of the screen (???).",2,ItsGoneMissing

S10s camera is far superior as the 12 doesn’t have a telephoto lens which has been standard on all flagships for years but apple want you to spend extra on the pro. Even though I don’t like the curved screen, the image was better. Android navigations feel more common sensical to me, like why do I have to press a select button at the top right before highlighting photos etc? Why is the back button in a completely different place depending on what menu or app you are in? The swipe back control never works first time. 

BUT the iPhone is way way quicker, smoother, never glitches, crashes or stutters which makes it way more enjoyable to use. Feels better in the hand. The battery, even though it’s smaller just lasts forever. Apple Pay is awesome, I no longer have a wallet. The new privacy controls make me feel invincible.

I’m not going to read all the other comments from people so people may have already addressed these points, but anyway:
1- to go back on pretty much any screen swipe from the left edge of the screen inwards. The exception to this rule is if the content you’re looking is using the stack UI (I can’t remember the proper name) where content slides up from the bottom of the screen and then leaves a small area at the top of the screen where you can see the previous content behind it. In that instance swipe down on the content to make it go away. An example of this is in the App Store when you look at screenshots. Over time you learn to recognise the different UIs and build your muscle memory

2- on your point about one handed use there are few things that can help with that. The main one is called Reachability which moves the whole screen down so that you can reach the top with one hand. To activate it swipe down and off the bottom edge of the screen. This is quite tricky to do except from on the Home Screen, so another way you can access it is go to Settings > Accessibility > Touch > Back Tap and then you can set actions for double and triple tapping the back of your phone. I current have reachability set to a double tap. 

3- on your comment about your S7 showing it’s age after 5 years, that’s the best thing about iPhones. You likely will still be using this phone in 5 years and it will be running as well as the day you bought it. I just came from an iPhone 8+ (4 years old) and it was not showing even a hint of lag, I only changed because I felt like it.

I had iPhone 4,4s, 5, 5s. 6 came out and I wasn’t impressed. It looked cheap and didn’t feel like it was moving forward, so I moved on to android. I had a galaxy 6, a nexus 6p, a pixel 1xl, 2xl, one plus 6t, pixel 4xl and pixel 5. 

So over the last 8 years I’ve experienced a lot of android growth and change. This spring I decided to get an iPad Pro. It just got me when it was announced with the M1 chip. I love it and decided that since I really hate the design of the pixel 6 and the iPhone seemed to finally have almost all the android features I’ve felt were missing I decided to finally go back and get a  13 pro max. 

I agree with the luxury comment. It simply feels like a piece of art in hand.  It’s incredibly solid (pixel 5 was very light and cheap feeling) and it’s just buttery smooth with all things I do. While the iPad started life as a “big iPhone” the iPhone 13 pro max feels like a smaller iPad Pro. I’m incredibly impressed. The other thing is Face ID. It works so flawlessly. I had the pixel 4 and the Face ID was awful. If you weren’t looking straight at it it failed. If you squinted a little (like early morning) it failed. If it was a little off angle it failed. It was so terrible. Face ID is near magic.

And there is nothing that compares to the AirPods experience of just putting them on and using them. And when I’m watching something on my iPad and want to hear something on my phone. Just press play and it switches. Also typing on android was a nightmare. It’s so good on iPhone. I’m really happy where Apple has gone.",1,rservello

This is how I went back and forth before sticking to android for good.

Iphone 4 - iphone 6 - Sony Xperia xa - OnePlus 5 - Samsung S10E - Poco F2 pro - iphone 12 mini - now Xiaomi mi 10t.

Reason why I stuck with android is mainly due to the customizability, fingerprint ID, audio app for my wireless earbuds that sounds way way better than the airpods for 1/3 of the price, OS such as back buttons at the bottom, fast charging, 120 Hz display and of course the price of android phones.

The reason why I returned the 12 mini is partly due to the battery life and everything else I mentioned above. Not saying that apple or iphones are bad but for the price, I could have gotten a much better alternative. Oh and the horrible lens flare I get from it. Lens flare was the last straw for me. 

Apple seem polished in that regard to apps and optimization but it just feels restricted imo. Though I still gravitate to new apple product release but until they come out with something new that android phone doesnt have, I won't be switching over anytime soon. 

Just my 2 cents. Iphones aren't as they make out to be at least to me. Had a lot of expectations but it's the same old same old here on out.",1,None

When you cant swipe back any further, you're at the first screen in an app and you can swipe up to go home if you'd like to go back.

Apple Pencil support would be great for taking memos, inking documents, and drawing on the go. The Max isn’t much smaller than the iPad Mini either. But I guess that won’t happen now that Pencil 2 can’t charge by itself.

I don't need a workhorse phone for anything crazy, and just use my S10 for texts and calling. I used to play CoD and an NBA game on my S10, but have long uninstalled them. I do care a little about camera quality since I want to start traveling come end of the year. 

I have an M1 MBA, and wanted to switch to the Apple ecosystem with the 13 and a watch. I will say that I don't know much about phone specs, but know the A15 chip will blow away the 855. I tried to find a site that compares the S10 and 13 specs, and found this [comparison](https://www.phonearena.com/phones/compare/Samsung-Galaxy-S10,Apple-iPhone-13/phones/10959,11634). I imagine the 13's camera software makes it much better than the S10's despite the similar specs? 

So, is the 13 worth the switch from my S10 or should I wait for next year's iPhone? I like Samsung Health app, and am reluctant to give it up. I've thought about keeping my S10 instead of trading it in and keeping it just for the health app and built in heart rate sensor.

If you want value for your money that can be found with older android phones. If you want value for your money and don't care about anything else you probably are not looking at buying an iPhone. I have a LG V20 that has a removable battery and I paid $65 for it, that is value for your money. Yes this is my daily driver phone and I play Pokemon Go on it just fine! For someone who just needs a phone to do basic things this phone will serve you just fine. These phones can be found for $65 to $100. I am sure there is a plethora of used android devices that can be found for under $100 that still perform for a large number of users.",926,SaraAB87

I would personally prefer something like the upcoming Pixel 4a.

>Software 	We're an Android site, what did you expect? More objectively speaking, long-time Android users won't feel at home, notifications are a bad time, and iOS is still very restrictive.

>Battery life 	Varies substantially depending on use, but it can be pretty bad if you're hard on the phone.

>Screen 	Size and type are subject to taste, but pixel density and resolution are low for 2020, a 16x9 aspect ratio feels dated now, and these are some anachronistic bezels.

>No headphone jack 	Still an appreciated feature in mid-range devices, even if we've been forced to accept the loss in more expensive phones.

>No USB Type-C 	Isn't a dependency on worse proprietary standards great?

Really had to struggle to find some negatives there.  At least they admit they're mostly subjective.",10,Witty-Style

I think the AOD will go down as a crucial feature for maximizing the usefulness of those notifications. The beauty of Apple's approach (i.e. ""you don't have to make separate UX for the AOD because it is just a dim home screen in full"") will go a long way towards maximizing developer participation in making the AOD useful, because they don't have to do *anything at all*.",6,dccorona

You need a charger that can negotiate 9V at 3A. 

Make sure to keep the phone as cold as possible so the charge speed does not throttle back as it warms up. Take it out of the case for fastest charging to help cooling. A fan or air conditioner vent hitting it helps big time. 

 I have at least 10 Chargers that will push at least 27 Watts. You can even use a USB-C 65, 95, 140Watt Macbook or Air Charger to charge at 27 Watts. 

I’ve seen some videos of 30 Watt charging using a 14.5Volt 2 Amp setting that I don’t have. that actually hits 30Watts. This might only be for the China models but in the Legal and Regulatory section on the phone in some Countries it says 14.5V at 2V.",2,Magic_Bullets

However, they have choosen to limit everything in their system. You can't customize your phone....

About camera, coming from a samsung, the pixel 6 pro camera has the real advantage to offer photo that actually have the color and light of the reality.

Samsung photos tend to the yellow and, at night, are not reflecting the luminosity. In other words, the photos taken seem a fake...

In my mind, pixel phones need a better resolution. Photos are yet in 12 Mp even if the camera is 50 mp. We need to be able to take advantage of the 50 mp camera if we want.

We also need a true HDR. This has been said lot of time in the current thread. There is, for sure, space for improvements in term of resolution, colors, quality.

There's a bees dick between the iPhone and pixel cameras, it really depends on what your artistic preference is in their processing. Where the iPhone is arguably better is in consistency - it will consistently take a great photo, whereas the pixel 6 will give you a turd for for every few bangers that you get. Video of the iPhone is still unmatched though. The new super stabilisation @ 2.8k looks incredible, as does the 4K cinematic footage. 

The iPhone also gives you the ""photographic styles"" options to let you change how the actual image is processed from an early level, hopefully google adds something like this at some stage too.",-2,None

Low key want to sell my iPhone 14 pro and get a pixel 7 pro.,y7croa,"One more thing. If you don't mind risking a $50 restocking fee, always remember that you can try a phone for 14 days and then return it if you don't like it. This is honestly what I recommend to anybody who's thinking about switching over to a new OS. Now. Nowadays switching to a new OS is more than just changing a phone, you're changing an entire ecosystem. Now as somebody who has used the apple ecosystem, the Samsung ecosystem, and now the Google ecosystem, I'm finding myself loving the Google ecosystem the best. The reason is that it is the ecosystem that is most friendly with third-party products. For example, I'm using a Galaxy watch5 pro on my pixel 7 pro and getting the full features (with the exception of ECG, and blood pressure monitoring, but I blame Samsung for that). Also, as somebody who primarily uses windows OS for desktop computers, I can get text messages and phone calls from my PC. And I've also noticed, that using mostly Google apps on my iPad means that all of my data syncs up. So I kind of sort of have this Frankenstein ecosystem with multiple products. But it's all because Google is friendly with all those systems.

In the end, if you try the pixel out and discover that it's not your thing, it only cost you $50 instead of a 2-year commitment with some financing plan for a phone that you didn't want 🤷.",30,AndroidUser83

Low key want to sell my iPhone 14 pro and get a pixel 7 pro.,y7croa,"I actually own both phones and so I had the luxury of doing a Pros and cons comparison to both, and here's what I came up with:

&#x200B;

iOS Pros:

1. Apple Pay
2. Camera App
3. iMessage and FaceTime
4. Hardware (Premium feel and super fast processor
5. Apple watch is awesome
6. Airpods are awesome too

iOS Cons:

1. Photo Management
2. Siri Sucks compared to Google Assistant
3. Apps changed out for default apps still treated like 2nd class apps ( ex. Google Chrome in place of safari)
4. Still no true file management system which makes document handling a pain
5. text-to-speech - well that's not really a thing on iOS is it cus it's absolutely terrible
6. The Keyboard. It's just not that great compared to Gboard

&#x200B;

Pixel OS Pros:

1. Gboard - it's just a better keyboard all around
2. Independent video controls for the web
3. ""Now Playing"" giving you a list sof songs playin in the background
4. Google Wallet - it's just better than Apple Pay imo
5. Call Screening, Call Holding, and Direct my Call are absolute game changers for smartphones
6. Any apps work, not just those from the play store
7. Google translate in the keyboard and available in all apps
8. Camera App is way more fun to use and has more features
9. text-to-speech is gamer changer on Pixel. I pretty much barely type on the keyboard.
10. Pixel Buds Pro - May not have Spatial Audio but the Noise cancellation is just as good imo and they fit better (for me at least). Plus, Assistant on the go is just - I'm sorry but Siri sucks! LOL

&#x200B;

Pixel OS Cons:

1. Phone does tend to get warmer to the touch more often
2. Battery life is definitely not as great, but that's due to Android doing way more things in the background compared to iOS
3. Lack of iMessage and FaceTime - those are just better apps for video calls and text messaging

&#x200B;

In the end I decided to use my P7 Pro as my daily driver cus although iOS is reliable and the battery life is way better, the Pixel still does get an all day battery which is good enough for me and it's just so much more fun to use.",96,AndroidUser83

But that's only because it can do everything you want it to without fail 99% of the time. It has all the bells and whistles while at the same time feeling like it doesn't. Kinda strange. 

I'm just too far into the Apple ecosystem at this point to completely abandon it and have a MacBook Pro and Apple TV 4K that it works so well with. But I also have a ton of Google apps. Just not a ton of Google hardware outside of a Nest thermostat. I think I enjoy the look and feel of the Pixel more. But maybe the iPhone works a bit more seamlessly. I really can't decide yet.

I moved from iPhone to Android fully about 2 years ago, and frustrations with the S22U performance pushed me back to Apple. Now using what I consider to be the best Android experience alongside the best iOS experience, there’s just so many little things that would frustrate me with having to stick to one or the other. 

I think buyers remorse will always be a thing with changing ecosystem, but from my experience I would say that if you want to make a change to Android in general, the Pixel series has been the closest to what I wanted when I think “Android”.

Pixels have never been spec-reliant. You'll understand it when you use it. 

Besides having an excellent camera, the 7 pro is a better bang for your buck considering the useful pixel exclusive features you get (Now Playing, Hold for me, Direct my call, Call screening, Wait times, Recorder app, Live caption, Magic eraser, Photo Unblur etc etc).  It's hard to appreciate these features until you try other phones* although it also depends on the country you are*

It's just way more fun to use and easily the smartest phone money can buy. Ironic considering Tensor isn't the most powerful chip out there.

Folks keep talking about performance and power blah blah like they are trying to launch rockets via their phones  :D And the question we're asking is that what exactly is the IPhone doing with all its power? Is it smoother than a Pixel 7 pro in day to day use? No! I know people who are still rocking the Pixel 2 from 2017 and the phones still run smooth. Smartphone chips are very capable these days


The iphone is still the best phone for content creation though. It also has a better battery, and social media apps are better optimized for it

Low key want to sell my iPhone 14 pro and get a pixel 7 pro.,y7croa,"The iPhone 14 pro does have a better battery life and will get OS updates (not just security) for at least 6 years as compared to the 3 years of OS version updates on the Pixel 7 and 2 years of security. It also has a better FaceID unlock system which works in the dark because of the infrared sensors / TrueDepth sensor. It doesn't have a fingerprint scanner, but the Pixel 7's in display fingerprint scanner is a hit or miss with screen protectors. You'll need to find a TPU screen protector or a thin enough tempered glass screen protector that works well. You'll also be missing the quick mute button (if that matters to you), but I'm sure there's a work around using gestures or a little lengthier way to mute/silence the Pixel 7, but it's not as quick.

Also, the 14 pro has a better and very efficient processor. Efficiency is the key term here because it improves battery life. See this - [https://twitter.com/Golden\_Reviewer/status/1580897933171429376](https://twitter.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1580897933171429376)

Also overall the both the A15 and A16 are faster in raw processing speeds, but you won't notice much of a difference in regular browsing. Maybe for gaming, video rendering and certain intensive tasks this difference can be noticed. 

The Pixel 7 pro may have a slightly better camera, but it's a very minor difference in certain camera modes. The iPhone 14 pro still has a very good camera, video recording, extremely smooth camera switching on zoom and better cinematic mode. I don't think you'll miss too much. 

Also I think the highest variant on the pixel is a 512 GB. If storage space matters, the 1TB on the iPhone that you currently have is the only option that you have, unless you like transferring files once you hit close to that 512 GB to another drive using the faster USB-C transfer. 

I have the Pixel 7 and it has 5G/4G network issues (network drops) in my area and slower (half) speeds on 4G/5G downloads and uploads because of Samsung's not to great modem. Your mileage may vary here.",4,xdrpx

Siri is my OG voice helper but she's just not great compared to Android offerings.

Airpods Pros are what I use on both ecosystems so I really can't comment there. The Apple watch is really nice. The stuff that Apple forces upon you as a browser is nonsense.

We'll see, maybe i hate the Pixel and i'll once again be in a place where i have no good choices for Android phones, other than Samsung which frankly i swore i would never return to after having 3 different generations of Galaxies with a horribly reskinned OS.
