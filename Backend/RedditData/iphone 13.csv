IR on Pixel 4xl works good with a trained face model but it gives me eye strain so I turn off face unlock and manually type the password.  Still use it for selfies, but I think P6 Pro with Dual PDAF depth of field for selfies with high iso night sight portrait mode selfies would be the next ideal/logical step for Google.

I'm excited for Pixel 6.  And I think Pixel 7 might even add dual Bluetooth audio later down the road.  So I think if Pixel 6 is a success, things might change for Google and the Pixel in a good way. Display calibration will make or break the device IMO.  It has to be perfect like an iPhone in order to steal iPhone sales and iPhone customers.  So no black clipping, grey-scale uniformity, no green tint, no white balance shifting between high and low refresh rate modes, no grey-scale tinting at different brightness levels, no black clipping at different brightness levels, d65 white point, delta e less than 1 for color accuracy -- ditto all that for the HDR10 and hdr10+ display modes etc.

Only acceptable exceptions would be intentional black clipping at minimum brightness to compensate for lack of display adjustment and intentional raised shadows and colors at maximum brightness for the same reasons.",3,Gundam_net

Makes the comment that says the 13 Pro can almost be considered a generational improvement over the normal 13.

* iPhones that are 1 model newer aint a real upgrade
* iPhones that are 2 model newer is somewhat of an upgrade
* iPhones that are 3 model newer is becoming noticeable 
* iPhones that are 4 model newer are really worth upgrading too
* iPhones that are 5 model newer should be upgraded from
* etc etc

Typical upgrade cycle for phones have lengthened from 2 years to 3 years.

So if you're on a budget you may want to upgrade to the iPhone 13 if you're on an iPhone Xs or older.

This was the first year I didnt watch for the iPhone keynote. Since iPhone X the newer iPhones are just scheduled upgrades to me and nothing ground breaking.

If you're a keen photographer then a flagship iPhone is worth buying than any Canon, Nikon, Leica etc. as 

* you amortize the iPhone over 24-36 months 
* upgrades gets pushed to you
* the iPhone's on your person almost all the time except perhaps when its charging
* iPhones are at most 1/2 pound
* iPhones can send your edited photos/work any time or any place at your leisure

I'd only buy a dedicated still camera if I were

* working photgrapher that gets revenue from it
* retiree
* someone with a ""passion""",51,joyce_kap

I had the opportunity to demo a Pixel 2 a few years ago (when they were new) for a couple of weeks for my company. I didn’t have too much trouble getting used to the difference in navigation, and there were definitely things about the UI/UX that I liked, but the one thing I couldn’t get over is precisely the one thing you say is the reason Apple stands out: that buttery smooth, highly responsive interface. Even on Google’s brand-new flagship device, the interface just felt jerky and unresponsive. I mean, not like insanely so—measured likely in milliseconds and objectively imperceptible—but enough that it just didn’t feel as smooth as iOS.

Also, I found the keyboard more exact but less accurate. Hard to describe, but I think iOS, in addition to the actual autocorrect function, also has a slightly different (and possibly mildly predictive) target map overlaid on the keyboard that doesn’t actually correspond exactly with where the keys are shown on the screen but ultimately seems to more accurately predict which letter you’re intending to press. I found that the Android keyboard tended to choose the letter you actually tapped, even if it made no sense, but that made it harder for me to type with good speed/accuracy.

> The way iOS handles notifications is not just different from Android - it's worse. There's no indicator showing that a notification is waiting for you, other than on the lock screen.

I moved over from Android years ago. Before that I was very anti-Apple. Felt Apple-users were arrogant and had to pay for everything. What changed me were two things. Firstly. Using Android, then, I could not sync over my contacts from Samsung to my desktop unless I downloaded a 3rd party app which never worked. I'm talking about in the time of Samsung 2 and 3. Things may have changed since, it's too late. Also, with Samsung when I had problems with the phone and my cellphone provider would or could not help I was stuck. I even called Samsung in South Korea for support. They couldn't speak English. To get help I used to go into all kinds of messageboards. People were so into their phones and how could they make changed to their hardware the cheapest and easiest way to make it faster and more robust than the guy next door. I've had problems with iphone of course, but I've got a few places I can get help. FB groups that are helpful, official Apple messageboard and Apple Care. I have never been disappointed with Apple Care. 
I moved to iphone and, honestly, haven't looked back. I don't mind not having a cracked phone to add illegal apps. Don't mind paying for apps because I know that when there is a problem I've got someone to go to for help. 
In the beginning I also had a problem exiting apps. I felt stuck as you do. It becomes second nature and you get there sooner than you think.
I feel that Apple listens to its users. Of course there are mistakes and things go wrong. Glitches. It is not perfect. They are forever updating the ios to improve it. It shows they care. 
I am also not a camera person so I don't need the Pro Max. I've got the XR and within the next couple of years I'll upgrade. I'm also soon to buy the MacBook Pro. I'll be leaving Windows os. Why? I had Windows 7 on my Desktop. I needed to pay about $200 to upgrade. If I hadn't I would not get support for 7. My anti-virus stopped supporting me because I had to upgrade to W10.

The community here is pretty non-toxic compared to the android community which is also something I like a lot. I respect everyone’s decisions when it comes to phone but for some reason android users are always upset that I have an iPhone and always talk about how android is so much better and start bashing Apple and iPhones in general.",2,redmssm

I assume because the left swipe is a ‘back’ gesture in… most apps, this isn’t really a thing in iOS. And the back left gesture is by no means universal.

That leaves me manually pressing on tabs within apps (often times at the top of the screen - yes, I know there is a gesture to bring down elements with a quick thumb swipe down from the gesture bar) and it’s super annoying. In Instagram a right swipe from the Home Screen brings you to messages rather than Search, which would logically be the next ‘tab’ of the app. And within messages, you can’t swipe to ‘Rooms’ with another right swipe because swiping on *any* part of a conversation performs an action. Kind of infuriating.

Even Apple’s own apps have a lot of non-intuitive features. For example, I spent a good 20 minutes adding songs to a playlist in Apple Music, only to have that cancelled out because it doesn’t just *add*  the songs, I had to manually press ‘Done’ all the way at the top of the screen. I had just swiped back to go back to the playlist instead.

The inconsistency of the back swipe gesture is also crazy to me. In Tinder, for example, if you’re on someone’s profile the only way to go back is to press a downward facing arrow in the middle of the screen (???).",2,ItsGoneMissing

Can I ask have you moved files and stuff to your iphone how has that been like I presume it's not just like click and drop like on Android ( as in i can make a folder on my phone and drop stuff in to that file and then navigate to it in my phone)

S10s camera is far superior as the 12 doesn’t have a telephoto lens which has been standard on all flagships for years but apple want you to spend extra on the pro. Even though I don’t like the curved screen, the image was better. Android navigations feel more common sensical to me, like why do I have to press a select button at the top right before highlighting photos etc? Why is the back button in a completely different place depending on what menu or app you are in? The swipe back control never works first time. 

BUT the iPhone is way way quicker, smoother, never glitches, crashes or stutters which makes it way more enjoyable to use. Feels better in the hand. The battery, even though it’s smaller just lasts forever. Apple Pay is awesome, I no longer have a wallet. The new privacy controls make me feel invincible.

I’m not going to read all the other comments from people so people may have already addressed these points, but anyway:
1- to go back on pretty much any screen swipe from the left edge of the screen inwards. The exception to this rule is if the content you’re looking is using the stack UI (I can’t remember the proper name) where content slides up from the bottom of the screen and then leaves a small area at the top of the screen where you can see the previous content behind it. In that instance swipe down on the content to make it go away. An example of this is in the App Store when you look at screenshots. Over time you learn to recognise the different UIs and build your muscle memory

2- on your point about one handed use there are few things that can help with that. The main one is called Reachability which moves the whole screen down so that you can reach the top with one hand. To activate it swipe down and off the bottom edge of the screen. This is quite tricky to do except from on the Home Screen, so another way you can access it is go to Settings > Accessibility > Touch > Back Tap and then you can set actions for double and triple tapping the back of your phone. I current have reachability set to a double tap. 

3- on your comment about your S7 showing it’s age after 5 years, that’s the best thing about iPhones. You likely will still be using this phone in 5 years and it will be running as well as the day you bought it. I just came from an iPhone 8+ (4 years old) and it was not showing even a hint of lag, I only changed because I felt like it. 

Finally I’d recommend checking out the Tips app that comes preinstalled on your phone. It will likely show you some useful features that aren’t always immediately obvious",0,gashtastic

If you are at an app page you can't go back the only “back” that's left is the Home Screen. Swipe up from the bottom. If you stop the swipe around the middle of the screen you get the app switcher.

My current phone, the Samsung Galaxy S10+, is closer in size to the Pro Max, but it's a lil shorter and skinner than the Pro Max. I've been happy with my current phone's size, but I'm not sold on either of the Pro sizes. 😂 

Like, I'm worried the Pro is gonna be too small and the Pro Max being too big. And it's not like there's any major feature difference between the two, other than screen size and battery capacity. 

I have a feeling I'll end up with the Pro Max, but I'm being extremely indecisive... Let alone the whole color thing. I've always had blue or white phones, so would be nice to get something different this time. I actually don't like the colors all that much across the board lawllll.",1,FluxionFluff

I had iPhone 4,4s, 5, 5s. 6 came out and I wasn’t impressed. It looked cheap and didn’t feel like it was moving forward, so I moved on to android. I had a galaxy 6, a nexus 6p, a pixel 1xl, 2xl, one plus 6t, pixel 4xl and pixel 5. 

So over the last 8 years I’ve experienced a lot of android growth and change. This spring I decided to get an iPad Pro. It just got me when it was announced with the M1 chip. I love it and decided that since I really hate the design of the pixel 6 and the iPhone seemed to finally have almost all the android features I’ve felt were missing I decided to finally go back and get a  13 pro max. 

I agree with the luxury comment. It simply feels like a piece of art in hand.  It’s incredibly solid (pixel 5 was very light and cheap feeling) and it’s just buttery smooth with all things I do. While the iPad started life as a “big iPhone” the iPhone 13 pro max feels like a smaller iPad Pro. I’m incredibly impressed. The other thing is Face ID. It works so flawlessly. I had the pixel 4 and the Face ID was awful. If you weren’t looking straight at it it failed. If you squinted a little (like early morning) it failed. If it was a little off angle it failed. It was so terrible. Face ID is near magic.

And there is nothing that compares to the AirPods experience of just putting them on and using them. And when I’m watching something on my iPad and want to hear something on my phone. Just press play and it switches. Also typing on android was a nightmare. It’s so good on iPhone. I’m really happy where Apple has gone.",1,rservello

This is how I went back and forth before sticking to android for good.

Iphone 4 - iphone 6 - Sony Xperia xa - OnePlus 5 - Samsung S10E - Poco F2 pro - iphone 12 mini - now Xiaomi mi 10t.

Reason why I stuck with android is mainly due to the customizability, fingerprint ID, audio app for my wireless earbuds that sounds way way better than the airpods for 1/3 of the price, OS such as back buttons at the bottom, fast charging, 120 Hz display and of course the price of android phones.

The reason why I returned the 12 mini is partly due to the battery life and everything else I mentioned above. Not saying that apple or iphones are bad but for the price, I could have gotten a much better alternative. Oh and the horrible lens flare I get from it. Lens flare was the last straw for me. 

Apple seem polished in that regard to apps and optimization but it just feels restricted imo. Though I still gravitate to new apple product release but until they come out with something new that android phone doesnt have, I won't be switching over anytime soon. 

Just my 2 cents. Iphones aren't as they make out to be at least to me. Had a lot of expectations but it's the same old same old here on out.",1,None

In most apps (around 80% of them coded properly), the back swipe means you're removing the top layer to expose the previous screen you were on. When you cant swipe back any further, you're at the first screen in an app and you can swipe up to go home if you'd like to go back.

The remaining 20% of apps sort of handle the back gesture in the top left however they want. One that comes to mind is Apple's Calendar app that goes back to the month view from the first screen.",1,ABRuns123

Apple Pencil support would be great for taking memos, inking documents, and drawing on the go. The Max isn’t much smaller than the iPad Mini either. But I guess that won’t happen now that Pencil 2 can’t charge by itself.

I don't need a workhorse phone for anything crazy, and just use my S10 for texts and calling. I used to play CoD and an NBA game on my S10, but have long uninstalled them. I do care a little about camera quality since I want to start traveling come end of the year. 

I have an M1 MBA, and wanted to switch to the Apple ecosystem with the 13 and a watch. I will say that I don't know much about phone specs, but know the A15 chip will blow away the 855. I tried to find a site that compares the S10 and 13 specs, and found this [comparison](https://www.phonearena.com/phones/compare/Samsung-Galaxy-S10,Apple-iPhone-13/phones/10959,11634). I imagine the 13's camera software makes it much better than the S10's despite the similar specs? 

So, is the 13 worth the switch from my S10 or should I wait for next year's iPhone? I like Samsung Health app, and am reluctant to give it up. I've thought about keeping my S10 instead of trading it in and keeping it just for the health app and built in heart rate sensor.

They could of made something with a fresh design and be at a low price point. Not interested...
