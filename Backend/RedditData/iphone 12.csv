If other reviews are going to show the same results im going to cancel my preorder and just get 12 Pro. Very disappointing

EDIT: alright, after verge and mrwhoistheboss reviews I can see the improvements. Not 50% better light photos as I hoped but still better. Also, shorter night mode time coupled with better stabilisation will make the night time images sharper, since i rarely use tripod. I will keep the preorder  


Also interesting bit from dave2d is that 89% camera improvement for Pro Max that is advertised on the website is compared to 11 generation. He said the jump in low light photo from Pro to Pro Max is 10-15% improvement",752,PM_ME_CUTE_SM1LE

I'm still going to give it a shot just to see how I like a bigger phone (I had a 6+ for a hot second and didn't enjoy it. I'm betting they've improved the experience since then), but I might end up exchanging for a regular-sized Pro before Christmas.",6,None

I have really big hands and I mean REALLY BIG hands. To give you an idea of how big, my iPhone 7 plus fits in my hand, with a thick waterproof case on, and I still have almost an inch of room between the tip of my index finger and the top of my phone. I have almost and inch and a half of room between the tip of my middle finger and the top of the phone, so ya... I have big hands.

&#x200B;

So for me a really big phone, plus a huge battery and camera upgrade, are all pluses to me over buying any of the other phones. All these reviews complaining about the phone size are a plus for me because it means I will have a huge screen to work with, plus all the other benefits of the pro max. And trust me when I say I watch a TON of YouTube videos so I will be putting the battery through the numbers. So basically there is nothing negative about this phone that I've seen so far to make me regret my purchase.",7,The_Space_Wolf_

Coming from big android phones for many years, I was wary in the beginning of choosing the smaller pro instead of the max. But because the 12 pro didn’t have that many compromises to the max, I chose the smaller size. And with me not an avid photographer, Im glad I chose the smaller size. Now, if Apple actually made better use of the screen size, like fitting more on the screen, allowing split screen apps, then maybe I would have chosen the max.

The camera is better than the 12 Pro but marginally. Don’t buy the Pro Max for the Camera. Rather the battery and the large Display! But The Verge spoke well about the camera but they compared it to the Pixel, Samsung etc. Apple had us all hyped up for the new Pro Max though. 

The only reason I’m switching from my my X is for the camera and the battery. I rarely use my X to click pictures. My Pixel 3 is my go to for confident and sharp images. But my iPhone X is my main phone.

I have a 12 Pro now that I haven't set up yet, because maybe I want to return it and get a Max. The 12 Pro feels smaller than the XR/11 and I hate that the Max has a slightly better camera, especially since I use the telephoto lens all the time. But the Max is probably gonna feel way too big.

Most people will not notice the difference between a crop and full frame sensor during daylight hours, and with the way software/hardware has gotten better at handling ISO, the lower light benefits are not as great as they once were.  They’re still there just because larger sensors will always let in more light, but your average Joe Schmoe isn’t going to tell when viewing on insta/whatever.

Which means this is a spur of the moment type shots.
99% of the shots you’ll be taking will look the same as the regular pro.  

That 1% when you are in super low light and still want to take a photo handheld is where this extra $100 comes in. 
You can still achieve the same shot with a tripod with a longer exposure.

So when i got the gift you can imagine i did the same and ordered the Defender. It dropped from a table that's barely waist high and landed screen down, picked it up and it was nearly completely cracked and half the screen was black and i had read a few complaints of the same thing happening and due to the design of the Galaxy screen how it rolls around to give that infinity look and that makes it stick out too far that it doesn't protect it like the rest of iPhone. I preordered the iPhone 12 pro max this go around and you can damn well bet i bought another Otterbox defender that's normally $59.99 and you can bet that i didn't feel bad in any way shape or form to use the old warranty trick that still works with them and lifeproof ( believe they are the same company) and got a brand new case for the simple price of $7 bucks which is just the shipping. 

warranty>12 pro max defender case> purchased in store> just clicked Monday for the week so i believe it was the 2nd> stated the tabs were broke when i received it> new case on the way for 7 bucks. Straight score  


(wouldn't have done it had they provided any help with the screen repair since its a known problem that it doesn't live up to the standards and expectations... so if you would like a new otterbox the old warranty trick still works after a couple years. Enjoy",1,_Dreadz

It certainly isn't the usual XR/11 Ferrari Red, and the drastic change may be a deal-breaker for some even if I appreciate it. 

I am a bit more concerned about early reports of bad battery life while using mmWave 5G on the Pro. Ultimately, I am unlikely to encounter such issues in my rural area - however, it would be quite aggravating if 5G can't be toggled off to conserve power.

The 11 Pro Max had android level battery specs, with a 4,000 mah battery. It was kickass for lasting.

Looks like the 12 pro Max has a 3,600 cell, but also has 5G so on paper it would seem to do worse (if you keep 5G on). However the 5nm A14 chip should balance it out the same battery life as the 11 Pro Max in efficiency which is why they can afford the smaller cell battery.

With every phone, you can tell what it was designed *around*. There’s some key feature that everything else has to contend with, that sets the hardware narrative. For many years now, that feature was the screen. Making it big, bright, beautiful, and bezel-less was the big thing driving phone design, and all other considerations were secondary.  
>  
>The iPhone 12 mini feels like the first iPhone in a long time with a different goal. It was designed around the human hand and real pockets. It is an object that doesn’t aim to be judged against other smartphones (which are mostly big now), but to be judged simply as an object you need to hold. You judge a spatula or can opener or whatever by whether it’s easy to grip, by whether it fits in your hand. It’s about time we got back to judging smartphones that way, too.  
>  
>That design decision means that other things — like battery life — are secondary. But it’s nevertheless a strange kind of relief to hold it. You know the feeling when a buzzing noise you’d grown accustomed to suddenly stops and you realize you’ve been annoyed all day but couldn’t say why? It’s like that.  
>  
>Whether we admit it or not (and whether we hate it or not), we’ve subtly been adapting ourselves to ever-growing phone sizes. The iPhone 12 mini is adapted to *us*.

I went with the Pixel 5 to replace my iPhone 7 because I wanted a bigger screen and there was a really good deal here in the UK. I love that phone but the form factor of the mini is just really appealing. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I could live with the battery life. The Pixel easily gets 6-8 hours of SOT and it's just so liberating not having to think about whether or not the phone will run out of batter.

Overwhelmingly the reviews are saying this phone is perfect except for battery life. 

Apples never going to be comfortable releasing a mini and a pro mini where the pro mini has a smaller battery than the regular mini. 

Meaning that If they did make a pro mini they would likely handicap the regular mini to have the same battery as the pro. While not utilising the extra internal space on the regular. 


We have already seen that play out this year between the 12 and 12 Pro. 

The 12 has identical internals and battery to the 12 Pro, except for a plastic spacer where the 12 pro has a third camera and LiDAR scanner. 

If Apple had designed the 12 to be its own thing then that space wouldn’t be there and theoretically the 12 could have had a fractionally bigger battery. 

None of this matters all that much in the 12 the battery is good enough. 

But the reviews for them mini are that it’s just a bit shy of good enough. 

So the only priority for the mini should be optimising the space inside to get a larger battery in there. 

Please people, battery life is more important than cameras. 

The best camera is the one you have on you and if your phone is dead. It don’t matter how good the camera is. 

So let’s not demand a pro mini, don’t convince Apple to further cram extra cameras or LiDAR scanners into the mini. 

Miniaturise everything. Make the 5G radios smaller, Save as much space as possible and put a bigger battery in there. 


Honestly I’d if it was up to me I’d scrap the 5G, and at a pinch the ultra wide and use that saved space to get a bigger battery in there.  

(Or just make it one or two mm thicker)

All that said I hope the regular and mini phones get 6gb of ram next year and I see no reason why the mini shouldn’t be able to shoot Dolby vision at 60fps and have ProRaw",17,Portatort

Are there any reviews from actual engineers? Or people with common sense? I can't anymore.. it's like a wishlist of things in a perfect vacuum. They can't seem to understand the concept of tradeoffs. Smaller body means smaller battery. Just because you are used to 2 days doing everything on your phone all day long, doesn't mean that the mini's battery life suddenly sucks. For such a small phone, it's probably a good battery life if compared to similar phone/battery sizes. ""Battery life is below average"".. Average from what? Bigger phones? Yeah no shit sherlock.

My girlfriend and myself are looking to buy a new phone. We both have a first generation SE and both phones are struggling, so a a replacement is overdue. We are especially unhappy about the battery: we often have to charge our phones 2-3 times per day, even though we are working from home office and we don't use the phones as much as we would normally in a non-coronavirus world. After reading through the news in the morning, my phone is already at 70%, even though I just took off the charger.

We will continue working from home office until next June, but battery is still a concern for us. We use our phone for texting, calls, reading the news, listening to music and podcasts. We are not heavy users, we don't usually watch videos or play games.

We are considering the new SE, the 11 or the 12 mini. The new SE is attractive because of the price, but I think I would feel unhappy about the form and the screen, and as far as I know, battery is also a concern. The 12 mini looks great and I love the size, but I don't want to experience the same issues with the battery as I am experiencing now with the SE. The 11 is bigger than what I would like and I prefer the design of the 12 mini over the 11, but as far as I know, it's a battery champ, so maybe we will go for that one.

The blue + Saddle Brown makes for a nice, flashy, and elegant combination, but then black + black has this sleek, sexy minimalist look that goes well with a small iPhone because it’s reminiscent of the many years where I used to buy black iPhones with black cases.

I personally have a few minor complaints.

-	Battery life seems like a slight downgrade from the year before. It’s still decent (and pretty good on the Max model), but it seemed better the year before.
-	making such a deal of 5G is dumb. It currently has little to no coverage, and is using modems that aren’t that energy efficient, which means that if you actually want to use it, battery life will take a hit. 
-	no 120 Hz is still pretty sad. I remember saying it wasn’t a big deal until using a note 20 ultra. Holy crap, it seems like a dumb upgrade but the phone feels considerably better when using it. I can only imagine what would be of the smooth iOS animations with this refresh rate.
-	spec wise it is pretty meh. I don’t understand why apple won’t put a bigger battery and more ram. I know iPhone performs equally with less specs, but they could have a considerably better device with a larger battery and more ram. It would future proof it a lot. 
-	the front design is starting to look updated. As much as I dislike the hole punch, it is less distracting that the large notch we have now. I don’t hate it, but it should be smaller by now",5,hehaia

The iPhone 12 will be the model most people should get because they don’t need the extra camera lens, RAM, or storage options. The Pro Max isn’t much more than the regular Pro but not everyone wants the larger display and I’m not sure if the camera upgrades will translate to real-world results without pixel peeping.

I have a point-and-shoot camera with a 1” sensor, a mirrorless with an APS-C, and a full frame. Unless I’m hunting through pixels, I can’t see much of a difference between images in most situations. Low light video on the full frame is better but the image processing with the APS-C and even 1” get both of them close enough that my wife can’t tell the difference on our Samsung QLED (all at 4K 24/30/60fps). Low light photos often come out better on the 1”, without post processing, because it has better built-in processing with newer techniques. My full frame will take better lowlight shots in the end but it takes more post processing to make that happen.

I could be wrong and the Pro Max could make a huge difference. But I went with the middle child because I can still use it with one hand, the bump in RAM is noticeable for me since I’m constantly switching between 5-6 apps, I use the zoom lens all the time, and I alarmist always have my point-and-shoot with me which will take better photos (with more zoom) than any smartphone and can record HDR 4K video up to 60fps (HLG+) and take 1080p 240fps slow motion.",6,P_Devil

I recently got an Apple refurbished iPhone 12 mini, but it seems there is something wrong with the camera. I just want to know if I should return it. The camera does not balance light well at all, and everything that is slightly illuminated becomes overexposed – even when I manually lower the exposure!

Please see the examples attached. The first picture is what the camera automatically did while I was focusing on my cat. When I reduced the exposure, it still overexposed his white fur.  I had an iPhone 11 in the past and it seemed to do a better job actually. Is this normal for the 12 mini?

Also while Marques is fair in his review, I would not call his review a deep dive. I would wait for Anandtech or dpreview(just for camera). No one does deep dive as well as anandtech while dpreview provides professional perspective. But those reviews will take quite some time as they dont get ""review units"" from OEMs. 

Also I am curious about the sensor used in 12 pro max. I am assuming its IMX sensor. Sony uses IMX557 on its flagship with similar pixel size. Galaxy S20/S20+ uses IMX555. That said some of the other android flagships have way bigger sensor. Huawei uses 1/1.28"" IMX700(but RYYB sensor). Samsung uses 1/1.33"" sensor while Xiaomi uses 1/1.32"" from image vision. I think in next few generations Apple will keep putting bigger sensor. I also hope they put in periscope lens at some point. At least in Pro Max phone.

I’m also sure that Apple will probably send some updates in the future to improve on the camera, it’s just really hard to believe that having a sensor that’s almost 50% larger and having sensor shift technology doesn’t produce better images.",1,joeyg151785

Infact in a video with the photos full zoomed out, I would argue that you wont be able to make out the difference between a full frame DSLR photo and a photo from an competent flagship phone in good light.

If you buy the iPhone 8 it won't get updates for as long as this one.

You can get it for a cheaper price if you sell your old iPhone or trade it in.

If you want value for your money that can be found with older android phones. If you want value for your money and don't care about anything else you probably are not looking at buying an iPhone.

I would personally prefer something like the upcoming Pixel 4a.

>Screen 	Size and type are subject to taste, but pixel density and resolution are low for 2020, a 16x9 aspect ratio feels dated now, and these are some anachronistic bezels.

I literally never seem he not praise nor take a bad photo withe the iPhones, ever since his first reviews. Not saying that the cameras are bad, but all of the phone cameras are currently on level play field and a great photographer will create exceptional work with any high-end phone. Heck, even low-end phones like the Pixel line have amazing cameras (for a phone).

The real comparison should be a phone vs entry-level DSLR. And while this doesn’t affect most of the market, the truth is: software simply can’t match (yet?) the physical dimensions of an ASP-C or Full Frame sensor.

Any entre level camera will produce images that clearly one step ahead of the best smartphone cameras. And more and more I feel less compelled to compare them or even see the reviews bc they feel stale. Yeah, it lets some more light enter, or the Pro Max has a 20% bigger sensor... but the sensor is still 1/10th the size of a cropped camera sensor a best.

And even if current cameras are “good enough”, as an enthusiast, it feels unnecessary to still be so attached to any phone camera. They all suck, compared to real cameras. But they all excel in being a good all around camera to always have with you.

Finally: I just with for a breakthrough that allows for actual big sensors to take cameras to the next level on phones. I feel like the use of mirrors & periscopic cameras is a first step towards that, but I fear we’re still lagging behind and years away. Or, if the end user is still happily with existing tech with marginal yearly improvements - even the ones make possible by software are marginal - we might actually not get amazing cameras in a long time.",7,leodw

The Mini is just awesome to use. It almost feels like I never left the SE. Physically, it’s slightly larger than the SE but the screen is bigger and more crisp. It fits into my back pocket and I don’t worry about bending it. While I’ll miss the advancement in the new camera/lidar, I really ~~like~~ love using my phone now. It really is a great phone.",2,KeyCapsCrazy

I’m not not gonna blame it in a defect and think it’s either the way the battery is or a bad iCloud restore which happens before and kills the battery. I may have to do a fresh restore and see if the battery gets better because it drains so fast even without using video or gaming.,0,Zentrii
