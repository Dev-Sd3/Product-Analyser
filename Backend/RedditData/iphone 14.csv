Exynos one process images worse. It might change with s23u when it comes out. For now in EU region Pixel 6 pro imo is the real competitor for iphone in terms of cameras.

Curious about people making these claims are actually good at photography.

Been seeing a lot of claims about single shot performance from microscopic phone cam sensors exceeding RAW capabilities of big sensor cameras but I‚Äôm extremely skeptical because it‚Äôs usually by people very inexperienced in actual photography.

I think the AOD will go down as a crucial feature for maximizing the usefulness of those notifications. The beauty of Apple's approach (i.e. ""you don't have to make separate UX for the AOD because it is just a dim home screen in full"") will go a long way towards maximizing developer participation in making the AOD useful, because they don't have to do *anything at all*.",6,dccorona

About camera, coming from a samsung, the pixel 6 pro camera has the real advantage to offer photo that actually have the color and light of the reality.

Samsung photos tend to the yellow and, at night, are not reflecting the luminosity. In other words, the photos taken seem a fake...

In my mind, pixel phones need a better resolution. Photos are yet in 12 Mp even if the camera is 50 mp. We need to be able to take advantage of the 50 mp camera if we want.

We also need a true HDR. This has been said lot of time in the current thread. There is, for sure, space for improvements in term of resolution, colors, quality.

This is honestly what I recommend to anybody who's thinking about switching over to a new OS. Now. Nowadays switching to a new OS is more than just changing a phone, you're changing an entire ecosystem. Now as somebody who has used the apple ecosystem, the Samsung ecosystem, and now the Google ecosystem, I'm finding myself loving the Google ecosystem the best. The reason is that it is the ecosystem that is most friendly with third-party products. For example, I'm using a Galaxy watch5 pro on my pixel 7 pro and getting the full features (with the exception of ECG, and blood pressure monitoring, but I blame Samsung for that). Also, as somebody who primarily uses windows OS for desktop computers, I can get text messages and phone calls from my PC. And I've also noticed, that using mostly Google apps on my iPad means that all of my data syncs up. So I kind of sort of have this Frankenstein ecosystem with multiple products. But it's all because Google is friendly with all those systems.

In the end, if you try the pixel out and discover that it's not your thing, it only cost you $50 instead of a 2-year commitment with some financing plan for a phone that you didn't want ü§∑.",30,AndroidUser83

Low key want to sell my iPhone 14 pro and get a pixel 7 pro.,y7croa,"I actually own both phones and so I had the luxury of doing a Pros and cons comparison to both, and here's what I came up with:

&#x200B;

iOS Pros:

1. Apple Pay
2. Camera App
3. iMessage and FaceTime
4. Hardware (Premium feel and super fast processor
5. Apple watch is awesome
6. Airpods are awesome too

iOS Cons:

1. Photo Management
2. Siri Sucks compared to Google Assistant
3. Apps changed out for default apps still treated like 2nd class apps ( ex. Google Chrome in place of safari)
4. Still no true file management system which makes document handling a pain
5. text-to-speech - well that's not really a thing on iOS is it cus it's absolutely terrible
6. The Keyboard. It's just not that great compared to Gboard

&#x200B;

Pixel OS Pros:

1. Gboard - it's just a better keyboard all around
2. Independent video controls for the web
3. ""Now Playing"" giving you a list sof songs playin in the background
4. Google Wallet - it's just better than Apple Pay imo
5. Call Screening, Call Holding, and Direct my Call are absolute game changers for smartphones
6. Any apps work, not just those from the play store
7. Google translate in the keyboard and available in all apps
8. Camera App is way more fun to use and has more features
9. text-to-speech is gamer changer on Pixel. I pretty much barely type on the keyboard.
10. Pixel Buds Pro - May not have Spatial Audio but the Noise cancellation is just as good imo and they fit better (for me at least). Plus, Assistant on the go is just - I'm sorry but Siri sucks! LOL

&#x200B;

Pixel OS Cons:

1. Phone does tend to get warmer to the touch more often
2. Battery life is definitely not as great, but that's due to Android doing way more things in the background compared to iOS
3. Lack of iMessage and FaceTime - those are just better apps for video calls and text messaging

&#x200B;

In the end I decided to use my P7 Pro as my daily driver cus although iOS is reliable and the battery life is way better, the Pixel still does get an all day battery which is good enough for me and it's just so much more fun to use.",96,AndroidUser83

But that's only because it can do everything you want it to without fail 99% of the time. It has all the bells and whistles while at the same time feeling like it doesn't. Kinda strange. 

I'm just too far into the Apple ecosystem at this point to completely abandon it and have a MacBook Pro and Apple TV 4K that it works so well with. But I also have a ton of Google apps. Just not a ton of Google hardware outside of a Nest thermostat. I think I enjoy the look and feel of the Pixel more. But maybe the iPhone works a bit more seamlessly. I really can't decide yet.

I moved from iPhone to Android fully about 2 years ago, and frustrations with the S22U performance pushed me back to Apple. Now using what I consider to be the best Android experience alongside the best iOS experience, there‚Äôs just so many little things that would frustrate me with having to stick to one or the other. 

I think buyers remorse will always be a thing with changing ecosystem, but from my experience I would say that if you want to make a change to Android in general, the Pixel series has been the closest to what I wanted when I think ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.

Pixels have never been spec-reliant. You'll understand it when you use it. 

Besides having an excellent camera, the 7 pro is a better bang for your buck considering the useful pixel exclusive features you get (Now Playing, Hold for me, Direct my call, Call screening, Wait times, Recorder app, Live caption, Magic eraser, Photo Unblur etc etc).  It's hard to appreciate these features until you try other phones* although it also depends on the country you are*

It's just way more fun to use and easily the smartest phone money can buy. Ironic considering Tensor isn't the most powerful chip out there.

Folks keep talking about performance and power blah blah like they are trying to launch rockets via their phones  :D And the question we're asking is that what exactly is the IPhone doing with all its power? Is it smoother than a Pixel 7 pro in day to day use? No! I know people who are still rocking the Pixel 2 from 2017 and the phones still run smooth. Smartphone chips are very capable these days


The iphone is still the best phone for content creation though. It also has a better battery, and social media apps are better optimized for it

Low key want to sell my iPhone 14 pro and get a pixel 7 pro.,y7croa,"The iPhone 14 pro does have a better battery life and will get OS updates (not just security) for at least 6 years as compared to the 3 years of OS version updates on the Pixel 7 and 2 years of security. It also has a better FaceID unlock system which works in the dark because of the infrared sensors / TrueDepth sensor. It doesn't have a fingerprint scanner, but the Pixel 7's in display fingerprint scanner is a hit or miss with screen protectors. You'll need to find a TPU screen protector or a thin enough tempered glass screen protector that works well. You'll also be missing the quick mute button (if that matters to you), but I'm sure there's a work around using gestures or a little lengthier way to mute/silence the Pixel 7, but it's not as quick.

Also, the 14 pro has a better and very efficient processor. Efficiency is the key term here because it improves battery life. See this - [https://twitter.com/Golden\_Reviewer/status/1580897933171429376](https://twitter.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1580897933171429376)

Also overall the both the A15 and A16 are faster in raw processing speeds, but you won't notice much of a difference in regular browsing. Maybe for gaming, video rendering and certain intensive tasks this difference can be noticed. 

The Pixel 7 pro may have a slightly better camera, but it's a very minor difference in certain camera modes. The iPhone 14 pro still has a very good camera, video recording, extremely smooth camera switching on zoom and better cinematic mode. I don't think you'll miss too much. 

Also I think the highest variant on the pixel is a 512 GB. If storage space matters, the 1TB on the iPhone that you currently have is the only option that you have, unless you like transferring files once you hit close to that 512 GB to another drive using the faster USB-C transfer. 

I have the Pixel 7 and it has 5G/4G network issues (network drops) in my area and slower (half) speeds on 4G/5G downloads and uploads because of Samsung's not to great modem. Your mileage may vary here.",4,xdrpx

I vastly prefer the text to speech on Android. File system browser suffers greatly on iOS. Pixel definitely takes better night time photos, Apple does better for video. I don't have either phone heat up, so I've never had that issue. Apple definitely a big hands up on battery life. None of my pixel phones are as good. Siri is my OG voice helper but she's just not great compared to Android offerings.

Airpods Pros are what I use on both ecosystems so I really can't comment there. The Apple watch is really nice. The stuff that Apple forces upon you as a browser is nonsense.

I think a lot of people bury their head in the sand and assume that there is only a single ""good"" phone/manufacturer based on their own biases and that it isn't entirely driven by your own workflow and preferences.

We'll see, maybe i hate the Pixel and i'll once again be in a place where i have no good choices for Android phones, other than Samsung which frankly i swore i would never return to after having 3 different generations of Galaxies with a horribly reskinned OS.

The voice recorder that's able to transcribe everything in real time just blows my mind, every time I see a review on it and how it's used just makes me wonder WTF has Apple been doing?

I don‚Äôt have to keep going into different apps to control things. Very good quality of life details that are definitely worth it IMO.,8,esp211
